## ·â¥·ä≠ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (using ES Modules and import maps), TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **AI:** Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`) for recipe generation.
*   **Local Storage:** Used for persisting user profiles, recipes, shopping lists, and application state.

## üöÄ Setup and Running the Application

This project is set up to run directly in a browser that supports ES Modules and import maps, without a traditional Node.js build step for dependencies like React or `@google/genai`.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   A text editor (e.g., VS Code).
*   A way to serve `index.html` locally (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension, Python's `http.server`, or any simple web server).

### 1. API Key Setup

This application requires a Google Gemini API key to generate recipes.

*   **Obtain an API Key:** Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
*   **Environment Variable:** The application attempts to read the API key from an environment variable `API_KEY`.
    *   In a typical Node.js/bundler setup, you would use a `.env` file:
        ```
        API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
        ```
    *   **For pure client-side testing without a build process:** Since `process.env` is not directly available in the browser in this setup, you have a few options for local development:
        1.  **Temporary Hardcoding (Not Recommended for Production):** For quick local testing, you *could* temporarily modify `App.tsx` around line 33:
            ```typescript
            // const envApiKey = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env && process.env.API_KEY ? process.env.API_KEY : null;
            const envApiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; // Replace with your actual key for testing
            if (envApiKey) setApiKey(envApiKey);
            ```
            **Remember to remove this before sharing or deploying your code.**
        2.  **Using a Local Server with Environment Injection:** If you use a more advanced local server, it might have mechanisms to inject environment variables into your `index.html` or a linked JavaScript file.
        3.  **Create `config.js` (Recommended for Client-Side if no build):**
            *   Create a `config.js` file in the root directory (same level as `index.html`):
                ```javascript
                // config.js
                window.APP_CONFIG = {
                  API_KEY: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
                };
                ```
            *   Add this script tag to `index.html` **before** `index.tsx` is loaded:
                ```html
                <script src="/config.js"></script>
                ```
            *   Modify `App.tsx` to read from `window.APP_CONFIG`:
                ```typescript
                useEffect(() => {
                  // const envApiKey = typeof process !== 'undefined' && process.env && process.env.API_KEY ? process.env.API_KEY : null;
                  const envApiKey = (window as any).APP_CONFIG?.API_KEY || null;
                  if (envApiKey) setApiKey(envApiKey);
                  else console.warn("API Key not found. Please ensure it's configured in config.js or via process.env.");
                }, []);
                ```
            *   Add `config.js` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your API key.

### 2. Running the Application

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```
    If you received the files directly, just place them in a folder.

2.  **Serve `index.html`:**
    *   **Using VS Code Live Server:**
        *   Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code.
        *   Open the project folder in VS Code.
        *   Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel and select "Open with Live Server".
    *   **Using Python Simple HTTP Server (Python 3):**
        *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
        *   Navigate to the project's root directory (where `index.html` is located).
        *   Run the command: `python -m http.server`
        *   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.
    *   Other simple web servers will also work.

3.  **Open in Browser:** The application should now be accessible in your web browser.

## üìù Notes

*   **API Key Security:** The `API_KEY` should be treated as a secret. Never commit it directly into your version control system if hardcoding for testing. The `.env` file or `config.js` (if gitignored) approach is safer for local development. For production, the API key should be managed securely, typically by making API calls through a backend proxy.
*   **Simulated Features:** Some features like actual OAuth with Google/Apple, family group backend logic, and QR code scanning libraries are currently simulated or placeholders due to the complexity of full implementation without a backend.
*   **Camera Permission:** The `metadata.json` requests camera permission for the "Join Family" QR code scanning feature, even though the scanning itself is currently simulated.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Conceptual)

*   Full OAuth integration for Google & Apple sign-in.
*   Backend for family group management and real-time collaboration.
*   Integration of a QR code scanning library.
*   Voice input for shopping list and recipe interaction.
*   Dark mode and theme customization.
*   Advanced nutritional tracking.
*   Pantry item expiration warnings.
